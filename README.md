# Github Opensource Docs - UNiDAYS

This project includes any documentation that should be included in a UNiDAYS open source project. These documents are to make the experience of contributing to UNiDAYS projects enjoyable, easier and to outline appropriate behaviour within this domain. 

These documents are based on [Githubs guidelines for setting up your project for healthy contributions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/). 

If there is anything you think should be changed or altered, feel free to open a feature request or pull request using the guidelines outlined in the documents themselves.

### Includes

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
	Outlines the behaviours we do and do not tolerate, our responsibilities as maintainers and contributors, and how to action when you think the code of conduct has been broken.

- [Contributing document](./GUIDELINES/contributing.md)
	Guidelines on how to contribute including raising bugs or feature requests, opening pull requests and our styleguides.

- Templates
	For [bug reports](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), [feature requests](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and [pull requests](./pull_request_template.md).
	
### How to use in my project

- Copy the files in this repo into the root of your project. It has to go into the root for the templates to work in the expected way.
- Prune out sections not relevant to your project. For example - if your project doesn't contain any JavaScript you may not need anything referring to guidelines on how to write JavaScript or related tests.
- Congratulate yourself on your success.

### I think something is missing / needs to be changed

Follow [contribution document](./GUIDELINES/contributing.md). Raise an issue, create a pull request - whatever is relevant for your need.
